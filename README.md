# Shopify Admin Cleaner v1

A robust bookmarklet that helps clean up the Shopify admin interface by hiding redundant details. This tool helps you show/print only the information you need, with built-in safety features and error handling.

## Features

- One-click activation/deactivation
- No installation required
- Works with all modern browsers
- Zero dependencies

## Installation

1. Visit the tool's webpage
2. Drag the green "üßπ Toggle Details" button to your browser's bookmarks bar
3. Navigate to your Shopify admin orders page
4. Click the bookmark to toggle the cleaner

## How It Works

The bookmarklet injects a small CSS rule that toggles visibility of paragraphs containing subdued text (`.Polaris-Text--subdued`). Key technical features:

- Uses a data attribute to track style injection
- Implements rate limiting to prevent rapid activation
- Validates the current URL to ensure it's a Shopify admin page
- Checks for browser compatibility before execution
- Provides console feedback for debugging

## Security Features

- URL validation prevents execution on non-Shopify pages
- Error handling with user-friendly alerts
- Rate limiting prevents accidental multiple activations
- Safe style injection with proper attribute tracking
- Console logging for troubleshooting
