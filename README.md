# Shopify Admin Cleaner 

A simple bookmarklet that helps clean up the Shopify admin interface by hiding redundant details. This tool helps you show/print only the information you need.

## Features

- Hides subdued text elements in the Shopify admin interface
- One-click activation
- No installation required
- Works with all modern browsers
- Zero dependencies

## Installation

1. Visit the tool's webpage
2. Drag the green "ðŸ§¹ Hide Details" button to your browser's bookmarks bar
3. Navigate to your Shopify admin orders page
4. Click the bookmark to activate the cleaner

## How It Works

The bookmarklet injects a small CSS rule that hides paragraphs containing subdued text (`.Polaris-Text--subdued`), resulting in a cleaner interface without affecting functionality.
